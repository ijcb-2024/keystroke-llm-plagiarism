# Keystroke Dynamics Against Academic Dishonesty
The following repository contains the Pipelines for conducting evaluations using keystrokes for different scenarios.

The access to all the Pipelines and Datasets has been provided in this repository.

## User-Specific & Agnostic Scenario
For user based scenarios the pipeline '''User-Context-Dataset.ipynb''' contains the data preprocessing and you can create any combination of datasets for training and testing.

## Keyboard-Specific & Agnostic Scenario
For keyboard based scenarios the pipeline '''Keyboard.ipynb''' contains the preprocessing of Buffalo Dataset keyboard-wise for conducting analysis based on keyboard type.

## Context-Specific & Agnostic Scenario
For context based analysis, the pipeline '''User-Context-Dataset.ipynb''' contains the data preprocessing based on context in the SBU Dataset.

## Inter & Intra Dataset Scenarios
For dataset based analysis, the pipeline '''User-Context-Dataset.ipynb''' contains the data preprocessing for each dataset and can be combined for analysis for any combination.
